    "    * Update the samples based on the measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we want you to do is to write a method for step 4: `update_samples` that takes in a\n",
    "set of samples, the most recent command, the most recent measurement, and the\n",
    "motion and sensor covariances and does the following:\n",
    "  * use the motion_model method to update the sample based on the command\n",
    "  * use compute_weights to compute the sample weights from the\n",
    "measurement,\n",
    "  * resample a new set of samples,\n",
