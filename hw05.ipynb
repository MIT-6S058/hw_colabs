    "\n",
    "We have created a visualization tool for you in colab to visualize the RRT tree during your search. You can run the following code blocks\n",
    "and they will generate the visualized the map as well as some lines showing the edges in the RRT.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run this cell multiple times, you will see different RRT trees due to different random seeds.\n",
    "You will find that sometimes the tree has very few nodes -- indicating that your RRT algorithm finds a solution very quickly.\n",
    "Sometimes it takes many iterations to find the solution. This suggests that the algorithm is very sensitive to random seeds,\n",
    "which is bad for practical usage. Thus, in practice, we shuold always use improved RRT algorithm variants such as BiRRT (bidirectional RRT).\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend you try in your colab notebook to see how the hyperparameter `goal_sample_probability` will affect the search process.\n",
    "Specifically, try to set that probability to 0.05 or 0.2 and visualize your result.\n"
